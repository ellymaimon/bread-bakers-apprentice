## Description

Bread Baker's Apprentice is a web application made for bread bakers who want to store all of their recipes in one place while reaping the benefits of software built specifically with the bread baker in mind. A user can create, edit, delete, and view recipes and their automatically calculated details including hydration, total weight, and expected preparation time. Users can also convert from metric to imperial, and can log in and manage their recipes, while viewing a collection of all recipes stored in our database.
